Poe
was
born
in
Boston
the
second
child
of
two
actors
His
father
abandoned
the
family
in
and
his
mother
died
the
following
year
Thus
orphaned
the
child
was
taken
in
by
John
and
Frances
Allan
of
Richmond
Virginia
They
never
formally
adopted
him
but
Poe
was
with
them
well
into
young
adulthood
Tension
developed
later
as
John
Allan
and
Edgar
repeatedly
clashed
over
debts
including
those
incurred
by
gambling
and
the
cost
of
secondary
education
for
the
young
man
Poe
attended
the
University
of
Virginia
for
one
semester
but
left
due
to
lack
of
money
Poe
quarreled
with
Allan
over
the
funds
for
his
education
and
enlisted
in
the
Army
in
1827
under
an
assumed
name
It
was
at
this
time
that
his
publishing
career
began
albeit
humbly
with
the
anonymous
collection
of
poems
Tamerlane
and
Other
Poems
(1827)
credited
only
to
a
Bostonian
With
the
death
of
Frances
Allan
in
1829
Poe
and
Allan
reached
a
temporary
rapprochement
However
Poe
later
failed
as
an
officer
cadet
at
West
Point
declaring
a
firm
wish
to
be
a
poet
and
writer
and
he
ultimately
parted
ways
with
John
Allan
